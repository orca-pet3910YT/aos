 * Module Overview:
 * - This file is part of the aOS production kernel/userspace codebase.
 * - Review public symbols in this unit to understand contracts with adjacent modules.
 * - Keep behavior-focused comments near non-obvious invariants, state transitions, and safety checks.
 * - Avoid changing ABI/data-layout assumptions without updating dependent modules.
