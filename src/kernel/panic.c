 * Module Overview:
 * - This file is part of the aOS production kernel/userspace codebase.
 * - Review public symbols in this unit to understand contracts with adjacent modules.
 * - Keep behavior-focused comments near non-obvious invariants, state transitions, and safety checks.
 * - Avoid changing ABI/data-layout assumptions without updating dependent modules.

#include <panic.h> // This now brings in <debug.h>

// The actual panic implementation (panic_screen, panic_msg_loc) is in src/kernel/debug.c.
// This file (panic.c) can be kept minimal or even empty if all panic calls
// correctly use the new panic() macro defined in debug.h.
// If there were any old-style `void panic(const char* message)` function definitions here,
// they are superseded by the new system.

// It's good practice to ensure this file still exists and compiles,
// in case any part of the build system or older code still expects a panic.o object file.
// However, its functional role is now taken over by debug.c.

// Add a dummy function or comment to ensure the file is not completely empty
// if that causes issues with any build tools (though typically it shouldn't).
void _panic_c_dummy_func() {
    // This function serves no purpose other than ensuring panic.o is created
    // if absolutely necessary. Ideally, this file would be removed if unneeded.
}
